### Device Partitions

Device partitions are logical divisions of a storage device such as a hard drive or SSD. They are created to organize and manage data more efficiently. Here's why they are needed:

- **Data Organization**: Partitions allow you to organize data into separate sections, making it easier to manage and access specific sets of files.

- **Operating System Isolation**: You can install different operating systems on separate partitions, allowing for dual-boot setups or running multiple operating systems on the same hardware.

- **Data Protection**: By separating user data from system files, you can reduce the risk of data loss due to system failures or errors.

### `df` Command

The `df` command is used to display information about disk space usage on mounted file systems. Here's how it works:

- **Usage**: `df [options] [filesystem...]`
- **Example**: `df -h /dev/sda1`

### `du` Command

The `du` command is used to estimate file space usage. Here's how it works:

- **Usage**: `du [options] [files or directories...]`
- **Example**: `du -sh ~`

### `df` vs `du`

- **Purpose**: `df` shows disk space usage for entire file systems, while `du` shows disk space usage for specific files or directories.
  
- **Output**: `df` displays information such as total disk space, used space, and available space for each file system. `du` displays the total size of files and directories specified.

- **Scope**: `df` operates at the file system level, while `du` operates at the file and directory level.

### `df -h`

The `df -h` command is a variation of `df` that displays disk space usage in a human-readable format, using units like KB, MB, or GB.

### `du -sh`

The `du -sh` command displays the total disk space usage of a specified directory in a human-readable format. For example, `du -sh ~` would show the total disk space used by all files and directories in the user's home directory.

This combination of commands (`df` and `du`) provides comprehensive insight into disk space usage on a Linux file system, helping users manage storage efficiently.
