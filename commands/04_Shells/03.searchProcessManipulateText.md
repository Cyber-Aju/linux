Searching, processing, and manipulating text are common tasks in Unix/Linux environments. Here are several powerful tools and techniques to perform these tasks:

### Searching Text

#### `grep(global regular expression print)`
The `grep` command searches for patterns in files and outputs the matching lines.

1. **Basic usage**:
   ```bash
   grep "pattern" file.txt
   ```

2. **Case-insensitive search**:
   ```bash
   grep -i "pattern" file.txt
   ```

3. **Recursive search in directories**:
   ```bash
   grep -r "pattern" /path/to/directory
   ```

4. **Show line numbers**:
   ```bash
   grep -n "pattern" file.txt
   ```

5. **Search for whole words**:
   ```bash
   grep -w "word" file.txt
   ```

6. **Count matching lines**:
   ```bash
   grep -c "pattern" file.txt
   ```

### Processing Text

#### `sed`
The `sed` (stream editor) command is used for text manipulation and can perform search and replace, delete lines, and more.

1. **Substitute text**:
   ```bash
   sed 's/old/new/' file.txt
   ```
   This substitutes the first occurrence of "old" with "new" in each line.

2. **Global substitution (all occurrences)**:
   ```bash
   sed 's/old/new/g' file.txt
   ```

3. **Substitute text in-place**:
   ```bash
   sed -i 's/old/new/g' file.txt
   ```

4. **Delete lines matching a pattern**:
   ```bash
   sed '/pattern/d' file.txt
   ```

5. **Print specific lines**:
   ```bash
   sed -n '2,4p' file.txt
   ```
   This prints lines 2 to 4.

### Manipulating Text

#### `awk`
The `awk` command is a powerful text processing tool, particularly useful for handling columnar data.

1. **Print specific columns**:
   ```bash
   awk '{print $1, $3}' file.txt
   ```
   This prints the first and third columns of a space-separated file.

2. **Pattern matching and processing**:
   ```bash
   awk '/pattern/ {print $1, $3}' file.txt
   ```
   This prints the first and third columns for lines matching "pattern".

3. **Arithmetic operations**:
   ```bash
   awk '{sum += $2} END {print sum}' file.txt
   ```
   This sums the values in the second column.

4. **Field separator**:
   ```bash
   awk -F, '{print $1, $2}' file.csv
   ```
   This sets the field separator to a comma for CSV files.

#### `cut`
The `cut` command is used to extract sections from each line of input.

1. **Extract specific fields**:
   ```bash
   cut -d' ' -f1,3 file.txt
   ```
   This extracts the first and third fields using space as a delimiter.

2. **Extract specific character ranges**:
   ```bash
   cut -c1-5 file.txt
   ```
   This extracts the first five characters of each line.

### Combining Tools

#### `sort`
The `sort` command sorts lines of text files.

1. **Sort alphabetically**:
   ```bash
   sort file.txt
   ```

2. **Sort numerically**:
   ```bash
   sort -n file.txt
   ```

3. **Sort by a specific field**:
   ```bash
   sort -k 2 file.txt
   ```
   This sorts by the second field.

#### `uniq`
The `uniq` command removes duplicate lines from a sorted file.

1. **Remove duplicates**:
   ```bash
   sort file.txt | uniq
   ```

2. **Count occurrences**:
   ```bash
   sort file.txt | uniq -c
   ```

#### `tr`
The `tr` command translates or deletes characters.

1. **Translate characters**:
   ```bash
   echo "hello" | tr 'a-z' 'A-Z'
   ```
   This converts lowercase to uppercase.

2. **Delete characters**:
   ```bash
   echo "hello" | tr -d 'aeiou'
   ```
   This deletes vowels.

### Examples of Combined Usage

1. **Search, extract, and count**:
   ```bash
   grep "pattern" file.txt | awk '{print $2}' | sort | uniq -c
   ```
   This searches for "pattern", extracts the second field, sorts it, and counts unique occurrences.

2. **Search and replace in multiple files**:
   ```bash
   find /path -type f -name "*.txt" -exec sed -i 's/old/new/g' {} +
   ```
   This finds all `.txt` files and replaces "old" with "new" in-place.
