### Redirecting I/O

Redirecting input and output (I/O) is a fundamental concept in Unix and Linux shell programming. It allows you to change the source of input or the destination of output for commands. To control where the output of a command goes and from where a command reads its input. It helps in managing output logs, handling errors separately, and automating command input. 

### Standard I/O Streams
1. **Standard Input (stdin)**: File descriptor 0, typically the keyboard.
2. **Standard Output (stdout)**: File descriptor 1, typically the terminal screen.
3. **Standard Error (stderr)**: File descriptor 2, typically the terminal screen but used for error messages.

### Redirecting Standard Output (stdout)
1. **Overwrite a file**:
   ```bash
   command > file
   ```
   This will overwrite the contents of `file` with the output of `command`.

2. **Append to a file**:
   ```bash
   command >> file
   ```
   This will append the output of `command` to the end of `file`.

### Redirecting Standard Input (stdin)
1. **Read input from a file**:
   ```bash
   command < file
   ```
   This will use the contents of `file` as the input for `command`.

### Redirecting Standard Error (stderr)
1. **Overwrite a file**:
   ```bash
   command 2> file
   ```
   This will overwrite `file` with the error messages from `command`.

2. **Append to a file**:
   ```bash
   command 2>> file
   ```
   This will append the error messages from `command` to `file`.

### Redirecting Both stdout and stderr
1. **Overwrite a single file**:
   ```bash
   command > file 2>&1
   ```
   This redirects both standard output and standard error to `file`, overwriting it.

2. **Append to a single file**:
   ```bash
   command >> file 2>&1
   ```
   This redirects both standard output and standard error to `file`, appending to it.

3. **Using separate files**:
   ```bash
   command > output_file 2> error_file
   ```
   This will redirect standard output to `output_file` and standard error to `error_file`.

### Here Documents (heredoc)
A heredoc allows you to redirect a block of text to the standard input of a command.
```bash
command <<EOF
This is some text
to be used as input
EOF
```
Everything between `<<EOF` and `EOF` is treated as input for `command`.

### Here Strings
A here string allows you to redirect a single string to the standard input of a command.
```bash
command <<< "This is a single string input"
```

### Pipes
Pipes allow the output of one command to be used as the input for another command, enabling the combination of simple commands into complex data processing pipelines. Usage: Frequently used in shell scripts and command-line operations for tasks such as filtering text, transforming data, and chaining multiple commands efficiently.


```bash
command1 | command2
```
Here, the output of `command1` is used as the input for `command2`.

### Examples
1. **Redirecting stdout and stderr to separate files**:
   ```bash
   ls > stdout.txt 2> stderr.txt
   ```

2. **Combining stdout and stderr into one file**:
   ```bash
   ls > combined.txt 2>&1
   ```

3. **Using a pipe to pass output from one command to another**:
   ```bash
   cat file.txt | grep "search_term"
   ```
