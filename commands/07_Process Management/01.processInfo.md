Process management is a crucial aspect of administering Unix/Linux systems. It involves monitoring, controlling, and managing processes. Here are some key commands and techniques for process management:

### Viewing Process Information

#### `ps`
The `ps` command displays information about active processes.

- **Basic usage**:
  ```bash
  ps
  ```

- **Detailed information**:
  ```bash
  ps aux
  ```
  Options:
  - `a`: Show processes for all users.
  - `u`: Display the user-oriented format.
  - `x`: Include processes without a controlling terminal.

- **Specific user**:
  ```bash
  ps -u username
  ```

- **Tree view**:
  ```bash
  ps axjf
  ```

#### `top`
The `top` command provides a real-time, dynamic view of running processes.

- **Start `top`**:
  ```bash
  top
  ```

- **Common commands within `top`**:
  - `h`: Help.
  - `k`: Kill a process.
  - `r`: Renice a process.
  - `q`: Quit.

#### `htop`
`htop` is an enhanced version of `top` with a more user-friendly interface.

- **Start `htop`**:
  ```bash
  htop
  ```

- **Navigation**:
  - Use arrow keys to navigate.
  - `F9`: Kill a process.
  - `F3`: Search for a process.

#### `pgrep`
The `pgrep` command searches for processes by name and returns their process IDs (PIDs).

- **Find processes by name**:
  ```bash
  pgrep process_name
  ```

- **Find processes by user**:
  ```bash
  pgrep -u username
  ```

#### `pidof`
The `pidof` command finds the PID of a running program.

- **Find PID of a program**:
  ```bash
  pidof program_name
  ```

### Controlling Processes

#### `kill`
The `kill` command sends signals to processes, typically to terminate them.

- **Send the default SIGTERM (terminate) signal**:
  ```bash
  kill PID
  ```

- **Send a specific signal**:
  ```bash
  kill -SIGNAL PID
  ```
  Common signals:
  - `SIGTERM` (15): Terminate the process.
  - `SIGKILL` (9): Forcefully kill the process.
  - `SIGSTOP` (17,19,23): Stop the process.
  - `SIGCONT` (18,20,25): Continue a stopped process.

#### `killall`
The `killall` command kills processes by name.

- **Terminate processes by name**:
  ```bash
  killall process_name
  ```

#### `pkill`
The `pkill` command sends signals to processes based on their name and other attributes.

- **Kill processes by name**:
  ```bash
  pkill process_name
  ```

- **Send a specific signal**:
  ```bash
  pkill -SIGKILL process_name
  ```

### Monitoring System Performance

#### `vmstat`
The `vmstat` command reports virtual memory statistics.

- **Display system performance every 2 seconds**:
  ```bash
  vmstat 2
  ```

#### `iostat`
The `iostat` command reports CPU and I/O statistics.

- **Basic usage**:
  ```bash
  iostat
  ```

- **Report statistics every 2 seconds**:
  ```bash
  iostat 2
  ```

#### `free`
The `free` command displays memory usage information.

- **Display memory usage**:
  ```bash
  free -h
  ```

### Process Priorities

#### `nice`
The `nice` command runs a process with a modified scheduling priority.

- **Start a process with a lower priority**:
  ```bash
  nice -n 10 command
  ```

- **Start a process with a higher priority (requires root)**:
  ```bash
  sudo nice -n -10 command
  ```

#### `renice`
The `renice` command changes the priority of an existing process.

- **Change the priority of a process**:
  ```bash
  renice -n 10 -p PID
  ```

- **Change the priority of all processes owned by a user**:
  ```bash
  sudo renice -n 10 -u username
  ```
