Managing processes on Unix/Linux systems involves tasks such as starting, stopping, prioritizing, and monitoring processes. Here are some key commands and techniques for managing processes effectively:

### Starting Processes

#### `command`
Simply typing the command of the program you want to run in the terminal starts a new process.

- **Example**:
  ```bash
  firefox
  ```

#### `&`
Appending `&` at the end of a command starts the process in the background, allowing you to continue using the terminal.

- **Example**:
  ```bash
  firefox &
  ```

### Monitoring Processes

#### `ps`
The `ps` command displays information about active processes.

- **Display information about all processes**:
  ```bash
  ps aux
  ```

- **Display information about specific process**:
  ```bash
  ps -p PID
  ```

#### `top`
The `top` command provides a real-time view of running processes.

- **Start `top`**:
  ```bash
  top
  ```
  Press `q` to quit.

### Stopping Processes

#### `kill`
The `kill` command sends signals to processes to terminate them.

- **Send SIGTERM (terminate) signal**:
  ```bash
  kill PID
  ```

- **Send SIGKILL (forceful terminate) signal**:
  ```bash
  kill -9 PID
  ```

#### `pkill`
The `pkill` command kills processes based on their name.

- **Kill processes by name**:
  ```bash
  pkill process_name
  ```

### Prioritizing Processes

#### `nice`
The `nice` command starts a process with a modified scheduling priority.

- **Start a process with a lower priority**:
  ```bash
  nice -n 10 command
  ```

#### `renice`
The `renice` command changes the priority of an existing process.

- **Change the priority of a process**:
  ```bash
  renice -n 10 -p PID
  ```

### Example Usage Scenario

#### **Example: Starting, Monitoring, and Stopping a Process**
1. Start a process (e.g., `firefox`) in the background:
   ```bash
   firefox &
   ```

2. Monitor the process using `ps` or `top`:
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep firefox
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   top
   ```

3. Stop the process using `kill` or `pkill`:
   ```bash
   pkill firefox
   ```
