### Users and Groups

In Linux operating systems, users and groups play a crucial role in managing access privileges and permissions. Let's delve into the details:

#### Users

Users are accounts created for individuals or processes to interact with the system. Here are some key points:

- **Unique Identifier**: Each user has a unique username and password, along with a User ID (UID) used to identify the user to the system.
- **Permissions**: The UID determines the user's permissions and privileges within the system.
- **Types**: There are two types of users:
  - **Superuser (root)**: The root user has complete control over the system and can perform any operation.
  - **Regular Users**: Regular users are limited to the resources assigned to them and have restricted access compared to the root user.

#### Groups

Groups are collections of users who share common access privileges. Here's what you need to know:

- **Unique Identifier**: Each group has a Group ID (GID) used to identify the group to the system and determine its permissions and privileges.
- **Access Control**: Groups make it easier to manage access control by associating users with similar access requirements.
- **Types**: There are two types of groups:
  - **Primary Group**: The primary group is assigned to a user when the user account is created.
  - **Secondary Group**: A user can be added to secondary groups later, allowing them to have additional access privileges beyond their primary group.

Understanding users and groups is essential for effectively managing access control and ensuring the security of the Linux system. They provide the framework for assigning and enforcing permissions and privileges for individual users and groups of users.
