### User Information Commands

In Linux, several commands provide information about users logged into the system. Let's explore three commonly used commands:

#### 1. `users`

- **Description**: The `users` command displays the usernames of users currently logged into the system.
- **Usage**: 
  ```bash
  users
  ```
- **When to Use**: It's used when you want a quick list of usernames of users currently logged in.
- **Real-time Example**: Suppose you want to see who else is logged into a server before performing maintenance tasks. Running `users` will show you the list of logged-in users.

#### 2. `who`

- **Description**: The `who` command displays information about users currently logged into the system, including usernames, terminal names, login times, and more.
- **Usage**: 
  ```bash
  who
  ```
- **When to Use**: It's used when you need detailed information about users currently logged in, including terminal information.
- **Real-time Example**: If you want to see not only the usernames but also the terminal names and login times of users logged into a system, you would use `who`.

#### 3. `w`

- **Description**: The `w` command provides detailed information about users currently logged into the system, including usernames, terminal names, login times, system load average, and more.
- **Usage**: 
  ```bash
  w
  ```
- **When to Use**: It's used when you need comprehensive information about users currently logged in, including system load average.
- **Real-time Example**: When troubleshooting performance issues on a server, you might use `w` to check the system load average along with user information to identify any potential resource bottlenecks.

These commands provide valuable insights into user activity on a Linux system, allowing administrators to monitor and manage user sessions effectively. Depending on the level of detail required, you can choose the appropriate command for your needs.
